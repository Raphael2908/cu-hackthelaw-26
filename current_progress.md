# Current progress

Running build log. Newest at the top. Read `architecture.md` first for the design.

## Production stance — building the real product now

**Where we are.** This is no longer framed as a hackathon demo: it is the **production build**.
The stack runs against real Anthropic Claude on SQLite, Dockerized, with async dispatch. PR #2 is
retitled and rewritten as the production build, and `architecture.md` has been swept to a production
stance (offline mock mode is now the keyless *fallback*, not the default story).

**Done**
- Reframed `architecture.md` from "working web demo / on a slide / out of build scope / no infra
  deliberately" to a production posture: real Anthropic on SQLite is the run, Docker is in, Celery/
  Redis is the named scale-up path, real auth is the next step (not a slide).

**Done (production scale-up)**
- **PPTX ingestion** — `.pptx` now accepted at document upload. `_extract_pptx` (`python-pptx`,
  lazy-imported) walks each slide's text-frame shapes; joins slide blocks with `\n\n`. Same
  extractor path and error handling as PDF/DOCX/text: image-only/empty decks raise `ValueError`
  → HTTP 415, like scanned PDFs. Speaker notes excluded (on-slide visible text only). Frontend
  `accept` list updated; new offline `test_documents.py` covers happy path + empty-deck 415.

**Planned next (production scale-up — see `todo.md`)**
- **Celery + Redis** — replace the in-process background thread pool (`core/background.py`) with
  durable, retryable, horizontally-scalable Celery workers for the agentic worker→checker→ranker
  flows. The `coordinator` boundary stays; only the dispatch mechanism changes.
- **Perplexity web search** — give AI agents live web retrieval behind a tool/provider seam to
  improve citation-support retrieval; every fetched source recorded with its URL, still a claim and
  never a verdict.

## Real mode + bulk document upload + partner-chosen severity

**Where we are.** Committed to the real Anthropic provider and added case document upload. The stack
runs against Claude on SQLite, end to end.

**Decisions locked**
- **Real, not mock, from here on.** `.env` sets `PROVIDER_MODE=real` and `ENV=production`, so a
  missing key now fails loudly at boot (`config.py` validator). The mock-safe default stays in
  `config.py`, and `conftest.py` still forces mock, so the test suite runs offline with no key.
- **SQLite is the production store too — no Supabase/Postgres.** The earlier "Phase 1: swap
  `SqliteRepo` → Postgres" plan is dropped. SQLite (one file) is what we run for real; the repo seam
  stays, but we are not migrating off it.
- **Severity is the partner's up-front choice at case creation** (`low | medium | high | extreme`,
  with `extreme` newly added) — a dropdown, not derived from the process doc and never
  model-inferred. It defaults every task in the plan; the partner can still override per task.

**Built**
- Bulk document upload at case creation: `POST/GET /api/cases/{id}/documents` (PDF via `pypdf`,
  DOCX via `python-docx`, text decoded UTF-8; multipart via `python-multipart`). Uploads become
  `case_id`-tagged `draft` corpus docs; the planner prefers a case's uploads and falls back to the
  seeded demo drafts. Best-effort text extraction only — no OCR for scanned PDFs (rejected as 415).
- Planner severity/assignee/ordering enrichment moved provider → service (`services/planner.py`), so
  mock and real are symmetric and real mode no longer `KeyError`s on `severity`. Providers now
  return raw task scoping only. Added defensive `target_document_id` validation.
- `extreme` severity wired through ranker weights (1.0), the severity types (backend + frontend),
  and the badge. Auto-clear still only triggers on `low`, so `extreme` never auto-clears.
- Frontend: severity dropdown + multi-file upload on the create form, multipart-aware `apiClient`,
  `uploadCaseDocuments` wrapper, create → upload → plan flow.
- **Async dispatch (real-mode latency fix).** Approving a plan used to run every task's
  worker→checker→ranker pipeline synchronously inside the request — minutes of real model calls, so
  the approve request effectively hung (a 6-task plan processed ~4 tasks in 10 min). Dispatch now
  runs on a background thread pool (`core/background.py`, `ASYNC_DISPATCH`, `DISPATCH_WORKERS=4`):
  approve returns immediately and the cockpit polls (every 3s) to surface tasks as each finishes.
  The audit chain write is now lock-guarded so concurrent workers can't fork it; tests run inline
  (`ASYNC_DISPATCH=false`) for deterministic assertions. Pipeline failures fail safe → escalate to a
  human, recorded in the audit log.
- Docker: `backend/Dockerfile`, `frontend/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` (real `.env` mounted
  read-only; SQLite on a named volume).

**What's next**
- Tune the real `plan_case` / `review_document` prompts for quality; raise `max_tokens` for large
  documents (currently 2048 — may truncate).
- Replace stub auth with real SSO/JWKS before any non-demo use.

## Scaffold stood up — initial build

**Where we are.** Full spine scaffolded against the brief, runnable offline in mock mode.

**Built**
- Docs-first: `architecture.md` (spine), this log, `todo.md`, `marketing.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`.
- Backend (FastAPI, Python 3.12, `uv`): typed config (mock-safe), `Repo` ABC + `SqliteRepo` +
  `InMemoryRepo`, hash-chained append-only audit, Pydantic schemas.
- LLM provider behind a factory: `LLMProvider` interface, `MockLLMProvider` (replays fixtures,
  honours planted defects, controlled multi-run divergence), real Anthropic impl wired (lazy).
- Corpus + fixtures: EU Cellar-modelled docs, synthetic firm standard, process doc with severity
  labels, planted defects (≥2 non-supporting citations, ≥2 template deviations) + recorded ground truth.
- Supervision depth: worker review service, the three checker signals (citation support / precedent
  deviation / multi-run disagreement), ranker with auto-clear lane + random sampling.
- Breadth: planner (goal → proposed tasks), coordinator state machine, associate inbox + registry,
  templated debrief.
- Frontend (Next.js App Router + Tailwind): cases, plan approval, cockpit (queue + flag panel +
  one-click sources + approve/amend/reject), audit view, associate inbox, debrief.
- No-network tests: `conftest.py` (InMemoryRepo + mock mode) + coverage of worker, each signal,
  ranker lane/sampling, approval gate, decision audit chain, end-to-end happy path.

**Conventions locked**
- Provider-behind-factory; repo pattern; mock-safe centralized config; thin API + logic in services.
- Agents emit checkable claims/flags, never verdicts. Severity up front; uncertainty measured.
- Append-only, hash-chained audit; accountability vs supervision kept separate.

**What's next / first real steps**
- Provision a real Anthropic key, set `PROVIDER_MODE=real`, write/verify the real review prompts.
- Swap the curated corpus for live EU Cellar pulls (stretch goal — keep fixtures as the demo fallback).
- Tune signal weights + `SAMPLE_RATE` against a labelled set.
- Replace stub auth with real SSO/JWKS before any non-demo use.
