## Flexible worker — the planner tasks it; not every task is a firm-standard review

**Where we are.** The worker is no longer hardcoded to "review a DRAFT against the FIRM STANDARD."
The process-map section now carries a partner-authored **worker spec** (a `kind`, an `instruction`, a
`checklist`, the `checks` that apply, and `requires_standard`); the planner copies it onto each task;
the worker resolves it once and runs the right kind of work, returning a per-task-type output. The
supervision layer stays intact because every kind still emits the universal `findings` the checker
reads. On branch `feat/process-map-track-record` (PR #8). All §14 guardrails held: no agent verdicts,
nothing auto-approved, severity still the partner's up-front call, mock stays deterministic/offline.

**Built**
- **One worker entry point.** `LLMProvider.run_task(kind, instruction, documents, reference?,
  checklist, …) -> TaskResult` replaces the review-only call; `review_document` is now a thin
  `kind="review"` shim so existing callers/tests keep working. `TaskResult` adds `output_kind` +
  `payload` (the type-specific product) on top of the universal `findings`. Mock returns per-kind
  payload deterministically; the real provider composes the system prompt from the task instruction +
  a fixed "checkable claims, never a verdict, STRICT JSON" envelope with the per-kind output schema,
  and now also instructs **stable finding ids** (helps the disagreement signal in real mode).
- **`services/task_spec.py` (new) — the single source of truth.** `build_task_spec` resolves a task
  into `{kind, instruction, documents, reference, checklist, applicable_checks}`, resolving the firm
  standard **only when `requires_standard`** (no silent fallback), and layers the planner's
  per-task `ai_instruction` (previously stored and never consumed) onto the section instruction. Used
  by **both** the worker's first pass and the checker's disagreement re-runs, so the runs compared are
  provably the same call.
- **Task-aware checker.** `run_checks` runs only the signals that apply and returns `applied_checks`.
  Precedent deviation runs only with a reference standard (else neutral, **no fabricated flag**);
  disagreement re-runs via the shared spec (works for no-standard tasks now); citation support is
  always on. `compute_uncertainty` **renormalises over the applied checks** (a non-applicable signal
  is dropped from numerator *and* denominator), so a task is never made to look more certain because a
  check couldn't run. `applied_checks` rides onto the risk score; the cockpit shows a non-applicable
  signal as **"n/a"**, not a misleading `0.0`, and renders the per-kind output (key points / extracted
  obligations / drafted clause).
- **Planner wiring + fixtures.** The planner copies `output_kind`/`worker_instruction`/`checklist`/
  `applicable_checks`/`requires_standard` from each section (defaulted at read time via
  `normalize_section`, so seeded maps and omitted keys behave exactly as before). New seeded
  **`process-map-extraction`** (a no-standard `extract` section) + `draft-obligations-atlas` +
  mock review/payload exercise the new path offline.
- Tests: new `test_flexible_worker.py` (instruction reaches the worker; no-standard task skips
  precedent deviation with no fabricated flag; uncertainty renormalised; disagreement runs without a
  standard; per-type payload persists; default task still applies all three). `test_process_maps.py`
  extended to round-trip the spec. `make test` green (62, was 54), `make lint` clean, frontend
  `tsc --noEmit` clean. `test_checker.py`/`test_flow.py` pass unedited; `test_cellar.py`'s recording
  provider now hooks `run_task` (the worker's call shape changed).

**What's next**
- Real-mode tuning of the new per-kind instructions/prompts (offline mock unaffected).
- Optional: let the partner edit `worker_instruction`/`checklist` per task pre-approval (`TaskPatch`);
  show the instruction/checklist on the plan page; surface `payload` for `draft` tasks in the inbox.

## Planner delegation guided by the Trust Matrix framework

**Where we are.** The planner agent's nature-based delegation (architecture.md §6) is now framed
explicitly by the **Trust Matrix** (https://trust-transformed.netlify.app/): each task is read on
two task-intrinsic axes — **stakes** (consequence if *this* task is wrong) × **verifiability** (how
cheaply a human can check the output against an objective source) — and the four quadrants map to
the assignee. All §14 guardrails held: stakes is the *task's* consequence-of-error, **not** the
matter's severity (still the partner's separate up-front triage dial), so a high-severity matter can
still route mechanical, checkable tasks to AI.

**Built**
- **Planner system prompt (`providers/real/anthropic_llm.py::plan_case`)** rewritten around the Trust
  Matrix. The four quadrants → `assignee_type`: high-stakes/low-verifiability → *Reserve* (`human`);
  high-stakes/high-verifiability → *Augment* (`hybrid`, AI volume under human sign-off who owns it);
  low-stakes/low-verifiability → *Monitor* (`ai`, quality held by downstream sampling §7.3);
  low-stakes/high-verifiability → *Delegate* (`ai`, end-to-end within guardrails). Keeps the
  decompose-by-section instruction, the strict-JSON contract, and the explicit "do NOT route by the
  matter's severity" guardrail.
- **`architecture.md` §6** now names the Trust Matrix and adds the stakes×verifiability quadrant
  table; **`services/planner.py`** docstring points at the matrix.
- No behaviour change in mock/offline mode (the prompt is real-provider only; mock replays fixtures),
  so the track-record overlay and all downstream logic are untouched. `make test` green (54),
  `make lint` clean.

**What's next**
- Tune + eval the `plan_case` prompt on real cases to confirm the matrix produces sensible
  quadrant placement; still open: `review_document` prompt tuning, Perplexity web search, SSO/JWKS.

## Process maps + per-map agentic track record driving delegation

**Where we are.** Delegation (human/ai/hybrid) is now decided by the planner agent from the *nature*
of the task — **never severity** (gating on severity would starve a high/extreme-heavy firm of any
AI help). On top of that nature-based suggestion, the planner consults a per-process-map **agentic
track record** and graduates a section to AI where AI has earned a clean record, or pulls it back to
a human owner where it hasn't. All §14 guardrails held: outcomes never verdicts, plan stays an
editable proposal, severity remains the partner's up-front triage dial, mock stays deterministic.

**Built**
- **`services/track_record.py`** — `aggregate(repo, *, process_doc_id)` walks completed **AI/hybrid**
  tasks (terminal status) whose case used that process map, bucketed by section; outcome per task is
  clean (auto-cleared / signed off w/o amendment) or adverse (amended / rejected / escalated). A
  section is `clean` at ≥ `AI_TRACK_RECORD_MIN` (=3) completed with **zero** adverse. `apply_record`
  overlays this on the agent's suggestion: clean → AI; adverse → pull back to a human owner; fresh →
  keep the suggestion. Returns an `assignee_rationale` for each.
- **Planner (`services/planner.py`)** now aggregates the case's process-map record, applies the
  overlay per task, stores `assignee_rationale`, and records `process_doc_id` + graduated/pulled-back
  sections in the `plan_proposed` audit payload. The real `plan_case` prompt was rewritten to choose
  `assignee_type` by **task nature** (mechanical → ai; binding obligations → human/hybrid), not risk.
- **Process maps are multiple + selectable.** `corpus_documents` can hold many `process_doc` rows
  (each a map with its `task_types`). New `GET/POST /api/process-maps` (lightweight structured create,
  no document parsing) and `GET /api/track-record?process_doc_id=`. `ProcessMapCreate` schema added.
- **Seed** — kept the existing process doc as **Map A** and seeded a closed prior matter giving its
  `review_binding_obligation` section a clean record (so it graduates to AI and the track-record view
  has real history); added **Map B** (`process-map-nda-fresh`) with no history to demo the clean
  slate. Idempotent.
- **Frontend** — `assignee_rationale` shown on the plan page; process-map selector + inline "add map"
  on case creation; new `/track-record` page (per-section stats + completed-task log) and nav link.
- Tests: new `test_track_record.py` (per-map scoping isolation, clean vs adverse/escalated detection,
  `apply_record` graduate/pull-back/fresh, planner graduation + fresh-map integration) and
  `test_process_maps.py` (list/create). Existing tests unchanged and green — clean-slate delegation =
  the provider's nature-based suggestion = prior behaviour. `make test` green (54, was 43), `make lint`
  clean, frontend `tsc --noEmit` clean.

**What's next**
- Use *actual* process maps: upload a real process-map document and derive its sections via an LLM
  step (the interim is a structured create). Expose a true "no map" (fully optional) path.
- Still open: tune the `plan_case`/`review_document` prompts; Perplexity web search; real SSO/JWKS.

## EU Cellar — official API (not scraping) + worker grounding via tool-use

**Where we are.** Two follow-ups to the Cellar connector, on the same branch/PR. (1) The connector
now uses the **official CELLAR API** instead of scraping rendered HTML. (2) The **worker** can ground
its citations against real Cellar sources while drafting (Anthropic tool-use) — it's no longer only
the checker that touches Cellar. Both opt-in (`CELLAR_ENABLED`), default off, suite stays offline.

**Built**
- **Official API, not scraping (`providers/cellar.py`).** `HttpCellarConnector` now negotiates
  `application/xhtml+xml` (Formex XML for pre-2014 docs) and parses the result with a
  namespace-agnostic `xml.etree.ElementTree` walk that handles **both** XHTML and Formex; the old
  regex strip survives only as a defensive fallback when the payload isn't well-formed XML. Title +
  resource-type come from a best-effort **SPARQL** query (`/webapi/rdf/sparql`, CDM ontology); `kind`
  still derives from the CELEX sector as the reliable default and SPARQL only refines it. A proper
  `User-Agent` is sent. New config: `CELLAR_SPARQL_PATH`, `CELLAR_USER_AGENT`. The tri-state contract
  (found / absent / raise) and the §14.1 hard-vs-soft flag logic are unchanged.
- **Worker grounding via tool-use.** Added an optional `source_lookup` callable to
  `LLMProvider.review_document` (a plain `Callable`, so `base.py` gains no import and there's no
  provider→cellar cycle). The real Anthropic provider runs a bounded **tool-use loop** exposing a
  `fetch_eu_source` tool; the mock ignores it (offline, deterministic). `worker.run_review` builds a
  corpus-first, cache-on-hit `source_lookup` (repo access stays in the service) and passes it **only
  when `CELLAR_ENABLED`**, so mock/offline is unchanged and tool-free. The coordinator is untouched —
  worker and checker both resolve `get_cellar()` by default. The checker's multi-run review calls
  stay un-grounded to bound tool-call cost.
- Tests stay offline: `test_cellar.py` now drives `HttpCellarConnector` with a path-routing
  `MockTransport` (content vs SPARQL) — XHTML parse, Formex parse, malformed→regex fallback, SPARQL
  title precedence + type→kind refinement, English-language filter, junk-filename-title discard,
  SPARQL failure swallowed, status mapping — plus worker tests (source_lookup caches into the corpus;
  the tool is offered only when enabled). `make test` green (41), `make lint` clean.

**Verified against the LIVE EU Cellar API** (real `curl`s + the actual connector, not mocks):
- Content negotiation `GET /resource/celex/{CELEX}` with `Accept: application/xhtml+xml` returns a
  **303 → 200** to the cellar manifestation (`follow_redirects` handles it). Both modern
  (`32016R0679`, 351 KB) and **pre-2014** (`31990L0314`) docs come back as **XHTML** — the Pub Office
  converts old Formex via CONVEX — so one `ElementTree` walk parses everything; the DOCTYPE is
  harmless. A bogus CELEX (`99999X9999`) → `None` (absence), so fabrication detection holds.
- `62018CJ0311` (Schrems II) correctly resolves as **`case_law`** with the right English title.
- Two fixes the live test surfaced, now in: (1) the XHTML `<title>` is the internal OJ **filename**
  (`L_2016119EN.01000101.xml`), not a title → discarded via `_human_title`, real title comes from
  SPARQL; (2) the SPARQL title must be **filtered by language** — without it `LIMIT 1` returned
  *Croatian* for an English request → added an ISO-639-1 → Pub-Office language-authority map and an
  `expression_uses_language` filter. Both public endpoints; **no auth** needed.

**What's next**
- Still open: tune the `plan_case`/`review_document` prompts + harden structured-output parsing
  (`max_tokens` already raised). Perplexity web search; real SSO/JWKS auth.

---

## Live EU Cellar connector — citation signal can resolve real EU law

**Where we are.** The citation-support signal (architecture.md §7.1) is no longer limited to the
seeded fixtures. With `CELLAR_ENABLED` on, a cited CELEX that isn't in the corpus is fetched live
from the EU Publications Office, cached, and checked against the real source. Default is **off**, so
the stack and the test suite stay fully offline. Also raised the real-provider `max_tokens`
2048 → 32768 (both call sites) so large documents/plans don't truncate.

**Built**
- `providers/cellar.py` — a `CellarConnector` seam behind a `get_cellar()` factory, mirroring the
  LLM provider: `NullCellarConnector` (the default — always reports absence, keeps the stack
  offline/network-free) and `HttpCellarConnector` (lazy-imports `httpx`, fetches by CELEX via REST
  content negotiation `GET {base}/resource/celex/{CELEX}`, strips HTML → plain text, maps the CELEX
  sector → `legislation`/`case_law`). `get_cellar()` is `@lru_cache`d and returns the Null impl
  unless `CELLAR_ENABLED`.
- `services/checker.py` — `citation_support`/`run_checks` resolve a CELEX from the corpus first,
  then fetch live on a miss and **cache the fetched doc into `CORPUS`** (so it's one-click-openable
  via `GET /api/corpus/{id}`, like any seeded source). The `coordinator` is unchanged — it flows
  through the `get_cellar()` default.
- **The §14.1 guardrail, enforced + tested.** A fetch that *authoritatively* reports no such CELEX
  stays a **hard "fabricated"** flag; a fetch that *fails* (network/outage) is a **soft
  "unverifiable"** flag and the claim is dropped from the support-rate denominator — so an outage
  can never masquerade as a fabricated citation. The connector returns `None` for absence and
  **raises** (`RetryableError`/`ProviderError`) for transient failure to make this distinction
  load-bearing.
- Config + env: four mock-safe `CELLAR_*` settings (`ENABLED=false`, `BASE_URL`, `LANGUAGE`,
  `TIMEOUT`) + `.env.example` section. Architecture §9 documents the opt-in source.
- Tests stay offline: new `test_cellar.py` (10 cases) covers the hit (resolve + cache), absence
  (hard fabricated), and outage (soft unverifiable, excluded from rate) paths via an injected fake,
  plus `HttpCellarConnector` parsing/status handling via `httpx.MockTransport`. `make test` green
  (32, was 19), `make lint` clean. Existing tests unchanged — the Null default keeps them
  network-free.

**What's next**
- Confirm the exact EU Cellar `Accept` header / endpoint with a couple of live `curl`s before
  flipping `CELLAR_ENABLED=true` (the one external unknown; isolated to `HttpCellarConnector`).
- Still open on the real-provider todo: tune the `plan_case`/`review_document` prompts and harden
  structured-output parsing (only the `max_tokens` part of that item is done).
- Perplexity web search; real SSO/JWKS auth before any non-demo use.

## Breadth: planner decomposition + cockpit escalations lane

**Where we are.** Two of the four `## Next (breadth)` backlog items are done (branch
`feat/breadth-planner-escalations`, PR #7). Breadth components made solid and sensible — depth
stays in the checker/ranker/cockpit. All §14 guardrails held: no agent verdicts, nothing
auto-approved, severity stays the partner's up-front choice, mock stays deterministic, audit split
untouched.

**Built**
- **Planner now decomposes from the process doc.** The mock planner returned a static 4-task
  fixture regardless of the matter. It now walks the process doc's `task_types` **in document
  order and emits one task per section** — add/remove a section and the plan changes — fully
  deterministic for the offline demo and tests. `mock_plan.json` rekeyed from a flat list to a
  `task_type`→scoping map; new `fixtures.mock_plan_by_type()` (replaces `mock_plan()`); a generic
  deterministic fallback covers any section without scripted scoping. Still **raw scoping only** —
  severity (partner's choice), the process-section label, the default assignee and ordering stay
  in `services/planner.py`, so mock and real stay symmetric and severity is never a model
  inference (§6, §7.1). The real Anthropic `plan_case` prompt was strengthened to decompose per
  process-doc section and bind targets to supplied documents (not offline-verifiable).
- **Escalations get their own cockpit lane.** Escalated tasks — work that fell back to a human via
  a partner reject or a fail-safe pipeline failure — were lumped into the cockpit's "Decided" lane
  next to signed-off work, burying the one thing a partner most needs to act on.
  `services/views.py::cockpit` now returns a dedicated `escalated` lane and narrows `decided` to
  signed-off only (raw dict response, no schema change). The frontend `Cockpit` type gains
  `escalated: Card[]`; the cockpit page renders a distinct rose-styled **Escalations** section
  above the awaiting/decided grid, each row clickable into the detail panel; the "Decided" caption
  now reads "Signed off by the partner."
- Tests: `test_plan_decomposes_one_task_per_process_section` pins the doc-driven contract;
  `test_reject_moves_task_to_escalated_lane` covers the previously-untested reject path and asserts
  the task lands in `escalated`, not `decided`. `make test` green (24), `make lint` clean, frontend
  `tsc --noEmit` clean.

**What's next**
- The remaining two `## Next (breadth)` items: associate-inbox richer context (process-guideline +
  target-document excerpt; the hybrid AI-instruction-inline part already ships) and debrief
  carry-forward notes derived from amended flags.

---

## Presentation assets — README diagrams + screenshots

**Where we are.** The README is now presentation-ready. Done bar the demo video (placeholder in
place).

**Done**
- **Landscape, high-res diagrams.** Regenerated `system-design/architecture.png` (7752×3474) and
  `happy_path.png` (5985×3954) as balanced landscape diagrams via Mermaid → Chrome render, replacing
  the portrait/low-res originals. Corrected the happy-path copy to the locked design (severity is the
  partner's up-front choice, not derived from the process doc). Both embedded in a new README
  **Architecture** section.
- **Screenshots.** Captured seven real screens (mock mode, offline, deterministic) into
  `docs/screenshots/`: cases, plan-approval gate, cockpit (three independent signals + flag panel),
  one-click source verification, the two-stream hash-chained audit, debrief, and associate inbox.
  Driven through the live API + Playwright (system Chrome). Added a README **Screenshots** walkthrough
  and a **Demo video — coming soon** placeholder.

**What's next**
- Record the demo video and embed it under the placeholder.

## Celery + Redis dispatch — thread pool retired

**Where we are.** The committed scale-up path (architecture.md §8) is in: the in-process
`ThreadPoolExecutor` is gone, replaced by **Celery workers backed by Redis** — durable, retryable,
horizontally scalable, surviving restarts. The `coordinator` boundary is unchanged; only the
dispatch mechanism moved.

**Built**
- `core/celery_app.py` (the Celery app, no app-internal imports) + `core/tasks.py`
  (`dispatch.run`). Only the serializable `task_id` crosses the process boundary; the worker
  rebuilds repo + provider from their factories (`get_repo()` / `get_llm_provider()`).
- `coordinator.dispatch_task` now enqueues `run_dispatch_task.delay(task_id)` when
  `ASYNC_DISPATCH` is on (lazy import to avoid the cycle). `ASYNC_DISPATCH=false` still runs the
  pipeline inline in-process — the test/offline fallback. Deleted `core/background.py`.
- **Cross-process audit-chain integrity (the load-bearing fix).** With the pipeline on a separate
  worker process, the in-process `threading.Lock`s in `audit.py`/`repo.py` no longer coordinate
  with the API process — concurrent appends could fork the hash chain. Fixed at the store: SQLite
  now runs in **WAL** with `busy_timeout` + `synchronous=NORMAL`, and writes use **BEGIN
  IMMEDIATE** so read-then-write is atomic across processes. Added a generic
  `Repo.insert_chained(table, build)` primitive (atomic last→build→insert); `audit.record_event`
  uses it and the module-level `_chain_lock` is gone.
- Docker: `redis` (7-alpine, healthchecked) + a `worker` service (same image, runs
  `celery -A app.core.celery_app.celery_app worker`) sharing the **same** SQLite volume as the
  backend — the WAL/BEGIN IMMEDIATE writes are what make that shared file safe. Backend + worker
  get `CELERY_BROKER_URL`/`CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` pointed at `redis://redis:...`.
- Config + env (`CELERY_BROKER_URL`/`CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND`, mock-safe localhost defaults;
  dropped `DISPATCH_WORKERS`), `make worker` target, and `.env.example` section.
- Tests stay offline: conftest sets `task_always_eager` so the one async test exercises `.delay()`
  with no broker; new `test_dispatch.py` covers `insert_chained` chain integrity and the task body
  reconstructing repo/provider + routing. `make test` green (19), `make lint` clean. Verified a
  real worker boots against live Redis and registers `dispatch.run`.

**What's next**
- PPTX ingestion and Perplexity web search (the remaining scale-up items in `todo.md`).
- Replace stub auth with real SSO/JWKS before any non-demo use.

---

## Production stance — building the real product now

**Where we are.** This is no longer framed as a hackathon demo: it is the **production build**.
The stack runs against real Anthropic Claude on SQLite, Dockerized, with async dispatch. PR #2 is
retitled and rewritten as the production build, and `architecture.md` has been swept to a production
stance (offline mock mode is now the keyless *fallback*, not the default story).

**Done**
- Reframed `architecture.md` from "working web demo / on a slide / out of build scope / no infra
  deliberately" to a production posture: real Anthropic on SQLite is the run, Docker is in, Celery/
  Redis is the named scale-up path, real auth is the next step (not a slide).

**Done (production scale-up)**
- **PPTX ingestion** — `.pptx` now accepted at document upload. `_extract_pptx` (`python-pptx`,
  lazy-imported) walks each slide's text-frame shapes; joins slide blocks with `\n\n`. Same
  extractor path and error handling as PDF/DOCX/text: image-only/empty decks raise `ValueError`
  → HTTP 415, like scanned PDFs. Speaker notes excluded (on-slide visible text only). Frontend
  `accept` list updated; new offline `test_documents.py` covers happy path + empty-deck 415.

**Planned next (production scale-up — see `todo.md`)**
- **Celery + Redis** — replace the in-process background thread pool (`core/background.py`) with
  durable, retryable, horizontally-scalable Celery workers for the agentic worker→checker→ranker
  flows. The `coordinator` boundary stays; only the dispatch mechanism changes.
- **Perplexity web search** — give AI agents live web retrieval behind a tool/provider seam to
  improve citation-support retrieval; every fetched source recorded with its URL, still a claim and
  never a verdict.

---

## Real mode + bulk document upload + partner-chosen severity

**Where we are.** Committed to the real Anthropic provider and added case document upload. The stack
runs against Claude on SQLite, end to end.

**Decisions locked**
- **Real, not mock, from here on.** `.env` sets `PROVIDER_MODE=real` and `ENV=production`, so a
  missing key now fails loudly at boot (`config.py` validator). The mock-safe default stays in
  `config.py`, and `conftest.py` still forces mock, so the test suite runs offline with no key.
- **SQLite is the production store too — no Supabase/Postgres.** The earlier "Phase 1: swap
  `SqliteRepo` → Postgres" plan is dropped. SQLite (one file) is what we run for real; the repo seam
  stays, but we are not migrating off it.
- **Severity is the partner's up-front choice at case creation** (`low | medium | high | extreme`,
  with `extreme` newly added) — a dropdown, not derived from the process doc and never
  model-inferred. It defaults every task in the plan; the partner can still override per task.

**Built**
- Bulk document upload at case creation: `POST/GET /api/cases/{id}/documents` (PDF via `pypdf`,
  DOCX via `python-docx`, text decoded UTF-8; multipart via `python-multipart`). Uploads become
  `case_id`-tagged `draft` corpus docs; the planner prefers a case's uploads and falls back to the
  seeded demo drafts. Best-effort text extraction only — no OCR for scanned PDFs (rejected as 415).
- Planner severity/assignee/ordering enrichment moved provider → service (`services/planner.py`), so
  mock and real are symmetric and real mode no longer `KeyError`s on `severity`. Providers now
  return raw task scoping only. Added defensive `target_document_id` validation.
- `extreme` severity wired through ranker weights (1.0), the severity types (backend + frontend),
  and the badge. Auto-clear still only triggers on `low`, so `extreme` never auto-clears.
- Frontend: severity dropdown + multi-file upload on the create form, multipart-aware `apiClient`,
  `uploadCaseDocuments` wrapper, create → upload → plan flow.
- **Async dispatch (real-mode latency fix).** Approving a plan used to run every task's
  worker→checker→ranker pipeline synchronously inside the request — minutes of real model calls, so
  the approve request effectively hung (a 6-task plan processed ~4 tasks in 10 min). Dispatch now
  runs on a background thread pool (`core/background.py`, `ASYNC_DISPATCH`, `DISPATCH_WORKERS=4`):
  approve returns immediately and the cockpit polls (every 3s) to surface tasks as each finishes.
  The audit chain write is now lock-guarded so concurrent workers can't fork it; tests run inline
  (`ASYNC_DISPATCH=false`) for deterministic assertions. Pipeline failures fail safe → escalate to a
  human, recorded in the audit log.
- Docker: `backend/Dockerfile`, `frontend/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` (real `.env` mounted
  read-only; SQLite on a named volume).

**What's next**
- Tune the real `plan_case` / `review_document` prompts for quality; raise `max_tokens` for large
  documents (currently 2048 — may truncate).
- Replace stub auth with real SSO/JWKS before any non-demo use.

---

## Scaffold stood up — initial build

**Where we are.** Full spine scaffolded against the brief, runnable offline in mock mode.

**Built**
- Docs-first: `architecture.md` (spine), this log, `todo.md`, `marketing.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`.
- Backend (FastAPI, Python 3.12, `uv`): typed config (mock-safe), `Repo` ABC + `SqliteRepo` +
  `InMemoryRepo`, hash-chained append-only audit, Pydantic schemas.
- LLM provider behind a factory: `LLMProvider` interface, `MockLLMProvider` (replays fixtures,
  honours planted defects, controlled multi-run divergence), real Anthropic impl wired (lazy).
- Corpus + fixtures: EU Cellar-modelled docs, synthetic firm standard, process doc with severity
  labels, planted defects (≥2 non-supporting citations, ≥2 template deviations) + recorded ground truth.
- Supervision depth: worker review service, the three checker signals (citation support / precedent
  deviation / multi-run disagreement), ranker with auto-clear lane + random sampling.
- Breadth: planner (goal → proposed tasks), coordinator state machine, associate inbox + registry,
  templated debrief.
- Frontend (Next.js App Router + Tailwind): cases, plan approval, cockpit (queue + flag panel +
  one-click sources + approve/amend/reject), audit view, associate inbox, debrief.
- No-network tests: `conftest.py` (InMemoryRepo + mock mode) + coverage of worker, each signal,
  ranker lane/sampling, approval gate, decision audit chain, end-to-end happy path.

**Conventions locked**
- Provider-behind-factory; repo pattern; mock-safe centralized config; thin API + logic in services.
- Agents emit checkable claims/flags, never verdicts. Severity up front; uncertainty measured.
- Append-only, hash-chained audit; accountability vs supervision kept separate.

**What's next / first real steps**
- Provision a real Anthropic key, set `PROVIDER_MODE=real`, write/verify the real review prompts.
- Swap the curated corpus for live EU Cellar pulls (stretch goal — keep fixtures as the demo fallback).
- Tune signal weights + `SAMPLE_RATE` against a labelled set.
- Replace stub auth with real SSO/JWKS before any non-demo use.
