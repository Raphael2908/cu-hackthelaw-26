# Current progress

Running build log. Newest at the top. Read `architecture.md` first for the design.

## Scaffold stood up — initial build

**Where we are.** Full spine scaffolded against the brief, runnable offline in mock mode.

**Built**
- Docs-first: `architecture.md` (spine), this log, `todo.md`, `marketing.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`.
- Backend (FastAPI, Python 3.12, `uv`): typed config (mock-safe), `Repo` ABC + `SqliteRepo` +
  `InMemoryRepo`, hash-chained append-only audit, Pydantic schemas.
- LLM provider behind a factory: `LLMProvider` interface, `MockLLMProvider` (replays fixtures,
  honours planted defects, controlled multi-run divergence), real Anthropic impl wired (lazy).
- Corpus + fixtures: EU Cellar-modelled docs, synthetic firm standard, process doc with severity
  labels, planted defects (≥2 non-supporting citations, ≥2 template deviations) + recorded ground truth.
- Supervision depth: worker review service, the three checker signals (citation support / precedent
  deviation / multi-run disagreement), ranker with auto-clear lane + random sampling.
- Breadth: planner (goal → proposed tasks), coordinator state machine, associate inbox + registry,
  templated debrief.
- Frontend (Next.js App Router + Tailwind): cases, plan approval, cockpit (queue + flag panel +
  one-click sources + approve/amend/reject), audit view, associate inbox, debrief.
- No-network tests: `conftest.py` (InMemoryRepo + mock mode) + coverage of worker, each signal,
  ranker lane/sampling, approval gate, decision audit chain, end-to-end happy path.

**Conventions locked**
- Provider-behind-factory; repo pattern; mock-safe centralized config; thin API + logic in services.
- Agents emit checkable claims/flags, never verdicts. Severity up front; uncertainty measured.
- Append-only, hash-chained audit; accountability vs supervision kept separate.

**What's next / first real steps**
- Provision a real Anthropic key, set `PROVIDER_MODE=real`, write/verify the real review prompts.
- Swap the curated corpus for live EU Cellar pulls (stretch goal — keep fixtures as the demo fallback).
- Tune signal weights + `SAMPLE_RATE` against a labelled set.
- Replace stub auth with real SSO/JWKS before any non-demo use.
